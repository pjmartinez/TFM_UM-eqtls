Enrichment Analysis and protein annotation 
Using the list of unique and intersect IDs of each sample condition (e.g. Soft White, Touch White, Soft Red, Touch Red, etc.) 
in AgriGO v2.0 a Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA) was performed. This traditional approach, SEA, 
iteratively evaluates individual annotation terms one at a time against an established list of candidate genes for enrichment. 
After comparing the observed frequency of an annotation term with the frequency expected by chance an enrichment p-value is estimated; 
individual terms are deemed enriched if they are above the cut-off (e.g. p-value ≤ 0.05). 
In the present study, Fisher method was used for the statistical test. 
AgriGO uses version1 of the grape genome transcript (genoscope) so each term was converted 
from VCost.v3 to V1 using the ﬁle list_genes_vitis_correspondencesV3_1.xlsx available at https://urgi.versailles. inra.fr/Species/Vitis/Annotations. 
Protein annotation was carried out using UniprotKB and DAVID.
